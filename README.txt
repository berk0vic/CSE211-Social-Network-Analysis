1-)In some operating system the compile commands are different so,
for the compile the file run one of the commands below

a-) g++ --std=c++11 main.cpp
./a.out
b-) g++ main.cpp
./a.out
2-) Some of the algorithms I made to detect communities in the 5th section of the menu(Girvan Newman) work inefficiently and may take a long time to calculate,
so please wait at least 10seconds.
